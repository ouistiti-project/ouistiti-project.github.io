Ouistiti - Small featured HTTP server
=====================================

# Ouistiti

Ouistiti _(Ëˆwistiti)_ is the french name of [Marmoset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmoset)
a little monkey of the New World.

Ouistiti is a small web server to manage and to configure small devices.
It allows to create an **unified Web interface** for **security** on
**Documents**, **Websocket**, **Rest API** and more.

Ouistiti is dedicated to be embedded on device for control from a web server.

With *Ouistiti*, all pages, websockets, scripts are protected by the same way.
It is useless to manage the authentication by your-self.
 
# Features

 1) Multi HTTP versions: 
    * **HTTP/0.9** **HTTP/1.0** **HTTP/1.1** : *Ouistiti* is able to manage each version
    of the HTTP protocol from the requests or to accept only the requests of one version. 
    * **Keep Alive** connection: A client connection may be use for several requests.
    * **pipeline** requests: **Ouistiti** is able to receive request during the management
    of the previous one in the same connection.

 2) Secure HTTP *HTTPS*:
    **TLS/SSL connection** is available as module with *mbedtls* or *openssl* library.

 3) Authentication:
 The *authentication is available on all client connection*. The users'
 password may be encrypted for the storage. The following challenge
 are supported:

    * **Basic Authentication**: *Ouistiti* is able to check the users to the simplest way.
    * **Digest Authentication**: *Ouistiti* allows to create your connection page and check
    the rights.
    * **Bearer Authentication**: *Ouistiti* is able to create a token and all instances 
    of *Ouistiti* is able to check this token on the same network domain.
    * **OpenID Authentication**: Manage the users on a OpenID server (like Google) and
    *Ouistiti* checks the user's rights on it.
 
 4) Websocket:
 A module build a **Websocket bridge** between HTTP socket client and UNIX socket.
 It is able to manage the handshake and the transfer of data to your application.
 You develop a STREAM server on a UNIX socket, *Ouistiti* protects it on a HTTPS
 connection.

 5) HTTP streaming:
 Like the *Websocket*, *Ouistiti* is able to protect your stream's server. Your
 application should only send data on a STREAM socket, *Ouistiti* does the rest.

 6) Static documents:
 Like any webserver, *Ouistiti* is able to send any kinds of files to your client.
 And in the same time it can manage them on your server:
     * Rest API: it allows to manage the document files with a **Rest API** to 
     upload, delete, rename the files directly on the server.
     * Home directory: each user can manage his own directory with his private rights.
     * Range request: file may be broken into many chunks for the download.

 7) CGI/1.1:
 **CGI scripts** may be call from the client.

 8) Connection filtering:
 The server may start with a list of IP address to refuse or IP address
 to accept.
 
 9) Mono threading or multi threading:
 *Ouistiti* may be build to manage client connections with only one process, to
 be the fastest webserver.  
 Or it may create a independants process for each client connection, to create
 a sandbox around it.
